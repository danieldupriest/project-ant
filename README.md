# Project Ant

This is a personal project in which I will attempt to model ant trail pheromones and by running a simulation with a large number of ants, I hope to see emergent behavior that can be found in real ant colonies.

The simulation currently only tracks path pheromones left by every ant when foraging. The rendering code becomes slow very quickly as the paths lengthen, so I may switch to a GL rendering context before proceeding.
